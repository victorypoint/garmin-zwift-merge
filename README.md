# qz-zwift-merge
Merge Zwift FIT file with QZ Fitness FIT file to add Zwift location data to QZ Fitness

Zmerge is used to resolve a problem - Zwift FIT files calculate elevation/altitude incorrectly for treadmill incline. Specifically, negative incline is assigned 0 elevation. QZ FIT files, when synced to Zwift activities, don’t contain Zwift's location data (virtual lat/long), but they do contain correct calculated elevation. Zmerge will merge Zwift FIT location data (and other important data fields) with QZ FIT data including calculated elevation.

Zmerge is a Java command-line app. 
- Requires Garmin FIT SDK.
- Requires Oracle Java™ Runtime Environment 8 - 1.8.0 or higher.

Can be run as API or standalone from command line.

Call "java -jar qz-zwift-merge.jar --help" for command line usage.
